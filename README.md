## bamboo setup using terraform

# Context
Bamboo is a CiCd tool for building and deploying your code. This is a quick terraform repo for getting started with bamboo, I couldn't find any right terraform module for this so created it for my self.

# Steps for initializing 

* terraform init => gets the modules initialized 
* terraform plan => gives diff of infra
* terraform apply => gets your infra deployed in aws.
